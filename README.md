# Shors_Algorithm_Qcircuit

Upload of my experimentation with Qiskit and Shor's Algorithm

Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm that can factor large numbers exponentially faster than classical computers, making it a potential threat to modern encryption systems. It relies on quantum principles to efficiently find the prime factors of integers, which has significant implications for cryptography and data security.

One of the interesting topics I was able to explore as a result of the project is the Quantum Fourier Transform. We see Fourier Transforms all the time in signals, but the Quantum version has the ability to process and manipulate data in a parallel and quantum-parallel way, making it significantly more efficient for certain tasks, such as factoring large numbers using Shor's algorithm
